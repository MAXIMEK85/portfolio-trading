# RSI Scanner:

This Python script calculates the relative strength index (RSI) for selected stocks and generates buy/sell signals based on RSI levels.

Although it is designed for cryptocurrencies (e.g. BTC and ETH) and stocks (e.g. GOOG), it can be adapted to any ticker supported by Yahoo Finance.

## Features:

- Computes RSI for chosen tickers over a configurable period.
- Detects overbought (RSI > 70) and oversold (RSI < 30) conditions.
- Outputs summary tables of potential buy/sell points.
- Optional graphical visualisation of price and RSI.
